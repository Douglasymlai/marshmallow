**🤖 Assistant · 2026-07-07 11:14:26**

Done — full analysis is in [feather-rebuild-spec.md](feather-remake/feather-rebuild-spec.md), with scroll-stage screenshots in `feather-remake/captures/`. The TLDR:

**What the site is**: Feather is an AI email client ("Got Mail?" / "Inbox made beautiful"). The homepage is not a normal scrolling page — it's a **fullscreen, wheel-hijacked story** (page height = viewport; wheel events drive a scene state machine). I captured every stage by driving headless Chrome over CDP with synthetic wheel events, and cross-checked against the shipped CSS/JS.

**Main workflow** — 7 scenes in order, each announced by a fixed banner (exact taglines recovered from the JS): 
1. **Hero** — mail-item cards fly in, pile up, and orbit a hand-drawn feather saying "Got Mail?" 
2. **Brief** — items land on a notebook page under MUST SEE / FYI / LOW PRIORITY; a feather literally handwrites the rows; reply cards, YES/NO/MAYBE stamps, FOLLOW UP stickers 
3. **Room** — tabbed workspace (Job Application / Fundraising / Customer Conversation) with a data table, Table↔Insight toggle, and slide-in email thread panel 
4. **Search** — natural-language query receipts feed documents into a hand-drawn machine 
5. **People Wiki** — draggable postage-stamp contact portraits 
6. **Sorting** — a 3×3 card-catalog cabinet whose drawers eject papers and print a spending receipt 
7. **Footer** — links, waitlist stamp (`/nynov2025`), giant "feather" wordmark

**Structure**: 6 public pages (`/`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/source` gallery, plus hidden `/log` and `/nynov2025`). Static pages share a centered layout with a huge Cormorant Garamond title and a hand-pointer back button.

**Design system**: cream `#FEFEFB` + paper `#FCF8EF` + ink `#1A1A1A` with stamp-red/blue/orange accents; fonts are Gerstner Programm (commercial — needs a license or substitute), Geist + Geist Mono, Caveat/Mansalva handwriting, Cormorant Garamond; a fluid `--u` unit scales each scene like a poster; motion is pure CSS keyframes + SVG stroke-draw handwriting + `offset-path` flight, with a signature `cubic-bezier(.22,1,.36,1)` ease.

The spec includes the per-scene element/interaction tables you asked for, all named keyframes to reproduce, and rebuild notes. Biggest practical warning: most of the charm is ~120 bespoke illustrated SVG/PNG assets under `/landing1/` — plan for illustration work. Want me to scaffold the Next.js project and the scroll engine next?

keep the same design system and style. I will twist the rebuild with a new concept. 

It will be a self-organised github workspace, managing different, user discussion, roadmap, project, repo, issues of the repo, contributor's PR, each sprint management. the contributor event. 

matching the mail change to PR/issue change - reshape this concept and also will redesign each illustration style to reflect the items for the theme. 

write a new document for this concept Feather.workspace

- 🔧 `Write` — /Users/douglas/Desktop/inbox/feather-remake/feather-workspace-concept.md
- 🔧 `SendUserFile` — 

**🤖 Assistant · 2026-07-07 11:29:06**

The concept spec is written: [feather-workspace-concept.md](feather-remake/feather-workspace-concept.md), alongside the original rebuild spec.

The core idea holding it together is a one-to-one "Rosetta stone" mapping from mail objects to GitHub objects, so every existing animation and prop gets reused rather than reinvented. The luckiest mappings:

- **YES / NO / MAYBE stamps → APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / COMMENT** — review verdicts are literally rubber stamps, so `stampDown` carries over untouched
- **"Got Mail?" → "Got Issues?"** — keeps the double meaning
- **Spending receipt → sprint receipt** (points committed/done, PRs merged, cycle time, "shipped 🎉")
- **Flight ticket SFO→JFK → deploy ticket STG→PROD**, packages → release crates, promotions → bot noise

The seven scenes stay in the same order with re-themed content: Hero (repo-life cards orbiting), Brief (daily standup page — feather handwrites review requests, CI failures, unanswered review comments), Room (tabs become **Sprint 12 / Roadmap / RFC Discussion**, with a burndown dot-grid in Insight mode and commits dropping in as diff envelopes), Search (queries like "Send each first-time contributor a welcome comment"), **Contributor Wiki** (draggable contributor stamps plus an event-badge strip for first PRs, meetups, talks), Sorting (drawers relabeled Issues / PRs / Reviews / Sprints / Releases / CI Runs / Discussions / Dependencies / Bots), and the unchanged footer.

Two things worth flagging from the doc:

1. **Only two net-new props** are needed — the stitched diff envelope and the "merge machine" with a `squash` lever. Everything else is a relabel/redraw of an existing asset, which keeps the illustration sprint scoped (§4 is the full shot list).
2. A hard style rule I'd hold onto: **"GitHub semantics, Feather saturation"** — status colors read as todo/blocked/merged but stay in the pastel printed-ink palette, never GitHub's own UI greens/purples.

Natural next steps when you're ready: scaffold the Next.js project with the scroll engine, or mock up one scene (Brief is the highest-signal one) to validate the re-theme visually.

Built, verified, and committed. **Feather Workspace is running at `localhost:3000`** (dev server is up — scroll through it to see the full story).

## What's built

The full 7-scene wheel-driven story from the concept spec, in `feather-workspace/`:

- **Scroll engine** ([engine.tsx](feather-workspace/components/landing/engine.tsx)) — native scroll is hijacked exactly like the original: wheel/touch/arrow keys advance a flat step counter that maps to (scene, local step), with a direction-aware chapter banner, brand mark, and progress dots ([Chrome.tsx](feather-workspace/components/landing/Chrome.tsx)).
- **Hero** — 12 hand-styled repo-life cards (issue tags, deploy ticket STG→PROD, release crate, CI bell, LGTM doodle…) fly in, orbit the feather-on-a-git-twig mascot with the dashed **"Got Issues?"** bubble, and release on first scroll.
- **Brief** — the notebook standup page: MUST SEE rows write in with staggered reveals, and the artifacts are all interactive — the stapled suggest-comment checkbox, the slap-in **PING REVIEWER** sticker, and working **APPROVE / CHANGES / COMMENT** rubber stamps with the `stampDown` thunk.
- **Room** — folder tabs (Sprint 12 / Roadmap / RFC Discussion), a status-colored issues table, the **Table/Insight** toggle (burndown dot-grid + auto-written summary), and a slide-in issue thread panel on **View**.
- **Search** — five torn-edge query receipts activate one by one; matching documents fly out of the 3-D fan into the merge machine (with its little `squash` lever) and dependabot PRs come out stamped **REVIEWED**.
- **Contributor Wiki** — perforated portrait stamps that are actually **draggable**, attribute pills that pop around them, and the event badge strip (FIRST PR 🎉, HACKTOBERFEST ×4…).
- **Sorting** — the 3×3 cabinet (Issues…Bots): drawers tilt open, PR/release/CI papers eject and bob, and the Sprints drawer prints the full thermal-paper **sprint receipt**.
- **Static pages** — `/about`, `/contact`, `/waitlist`, `/log` with the Cormorant serif title treatment and hand-pointer back button.

Production build passes clean (all routes static), no console errors, committed as `2a6ade9`.

## Known trade-offs

- **Gerstner Programm** is substituted with Geist bold via the `--font-brand` stack — drop the `.otf` files into `public/fonts/` + one `@font-face` block and it upgrades automatically.
- Illustrations are pure CSS/SVG approximations of the hand-drawn style. They read well, but the original's charm came from ~120 bespoke illustrated assets — that's the natural next investment.
- The feather doesn't yet literally *handwrite* the brief rows (SVG stroke-dashoffset per the spec); rows use staggered reveals for now.

Want me to do a polish pass next — the SVG handwriting effect, mobile tuning, or richer scene illustrations?

- 🔧 `Bash` — Build and commit hero rework

**🤖 Assistant · 2026-07-07 14:03:41**

All five notes are done, verified in the preview, and committed (`57a4159`):

1. **Cards scatter across the whole screen** — the orbit ring is gone; the 12 repo-life cards sit at fixed positions around the full canvas (center kept clear) with a gentle floating bob.
2. **No logo beside the headline** — the feather glyph next to "Got Issues?" is removed; before scrolling the top-left brand mark stays hidden too.
3. **Hover gathers everything** — hovering "Got Issues?" folds every card in behind the bubble (staggered, scaled down, stacked underneath).
4. **Pop one by one in order** — once gathered, cards spring out on top of the bubble sequentially (~1.1s apart, spring easing) and cycle through the whole set; moving the mouse away returns every card to its scattered spot.
5. **Bottom scroll dots removed.**

Production build passes clean. The dev server is still running at `localhost:3000` if you want to feel the hover interaction with a real mouse — the gather/pop timing (850ms fold, 1.1s per pop) is easy to tune in [Hero.tsx](feather-workspace/components/landing/scenes/Hero.tsx) if it feels too fast or slow.

**🤖 Assistant · 2026-07-07 14:14:17**

All three notes fixed, verified in the preview, and committed (`51e45b8`):

1. **Paper dot background** — it was actually a one-line bug: the stage set `background: var(--cream)` as an inline shorthand, which silently wiped the dot-grid `background-image` from the `.dotted` class. Switched to `backgroundColor` and bumped the dots to a warm, visible ink (`rgba(140,135,128,.28)` on a 24px grid). Since it's on the shared stage, every scene now sits on the same paper.
2. **"Got Issues?" dead-center** — the bubble now lives in an absolute full-viewport grid overlay so it's exactly at screen center; the Feather wordmark hangs 58px below it (still only revealed after the first scroll).
3. **SCROLL hint pinned to the bottom** — absolutely positioned 26px from the bottom edge, centered, keeping its pulse animation.

The hover gather/pop interaction is untouched and the production build passes. Anything else you spot on the hero, or shall we move down the page to the Brief scene next?

- 🔧 `Bash` — Build and commit item redesign

**🤖 Assistant · 2026-07-07 22:16:40**

All four notes are done, verified in the preview, and committed (`0514ad0`):

1. **Background dots at 10% opacity** — the paper grid is now a subtle texture instead of a strong pattern.
2. **Slower pop switching** — items now hold for 2.2s each (was 1.1s) after folding behind the bubble, with a slightly longer fold-in beat and a softer spring on each pop.
3. **Bigger items** — everything scaled up roughly 40% (the clover, bell, and house are ~150px; the paper plane is 200px wide).
4. **More items in two rings** — 20 items total: an inner ring of 8 and an outer ring of 12, positioned on two ellipses around the centered bubble so the composition reads as concentric circles.

For the redesign, I studied your reference images and rebuilt each item as the same kind of flat, solid-color silhouette with integrated text, translated to the GitHub theme: the clover blob became "48 checks passing" (mono type), the bell carries curved "CI Alert" text along its dome, the round gray tag reads "#412 BUG" on its bottom arc, the folded-corner square is "PR #128 · Merged" with the little pen stroke, the stacked mugs are Maya and Kenji pair-programming, the house is the `feather/quill` repo with the yellow window grid, the green zigzag receipt with the orange paperclip is "Patch V3. diff", plus the notched deploy ticket, scalloped star seal, punch-hole RFC document, terracotta overlapping "New Release" squares, the paper plane "To reviewers:", and five more.

One suggestion while you review at full size: the two rings are tuned for wide screens — if any pair of items feels crowded on your monitor, tell me which and I'll nudge those positions rather than re-spacing the whole ring.

put the log of this whole chat message and run log of this session inside the marshmallow as a folder "prompt history"

I'll find this session's transcript and copy it into a `prompt history` folder in the marshmallow project, plus generate a readable markdown version.

- 🔧 `Bash` — Locate session transcript files
- 🔧 `Bash` — Check marshmallow project dir for transcripts
